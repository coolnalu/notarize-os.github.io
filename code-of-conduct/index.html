    <h1>Notarize Code of Conduct</h1>
    <p>In order to foster an inclusive, kind, harassment-free, and cooperative
    community, Notarize enforces this code of conduct on our open source
    projects.</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Harassment in code and discussion or violation of physical boundaries is
    completely unacceptable anywhere in Notarize’s codebases, issue
    trackers, chat rooms, mailing lists, meetups, and any other events.
    Violators will be warned and then blocked or banned by the core team at or
    before the 3rd violation.</p>
    <h2>In detail</h2>
    <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to level of
    experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
    disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion,
    nationality, the use of sexualized language or imagery, deliberate
    intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption, and unwelcome sexual
    attention.</p>
    <p>Individuals asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
    immediately.</p>
    <p>Maintainers, including the core team, are also subject to the
    anti-harassment policy.</p>
    <p>If anyone engages in abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable
    behavior, including maintainers, we may take appropriate action, up to and
    including warning the offender, deletion of comments, removal from the
    project’s codebase and communication systems, and escalation to GitHub
    support.</p>
    <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or
    have any other concerns, please contact a member of the core team or email
    <a href="mailto:support@notarize.com">support@notarize.com</a>
    immediately.</p>
    <p>We expect everyone to follow these rules anywhere in the Notarize
    project’s codebases, issue trackers, group chat, and mailing lists.
    </p>
    <p>This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public
    spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.</p>
    <p>Finally, don’t forget that it is human to make mistakes! We all do. Let’s
    work together to help each other, resolve issues, and learn from the
    mistakes that we will all inevitably make from time to time.</p>
